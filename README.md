The description of the data type can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#LWW-Element-Set_(Last-Write-Wins-Element-Set))

# How to run
You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or Jetbrains Rider to load the solution file - `src\LastWriteWinsElementSet.sln` and run the unit tests inside `src\LastWriteWinsElementSetTests\LastWriteWinsElementSetTests.cs`. These tools all run on both Windows and Mac. To run unit tests in Visual Studio Code, you need to have the C# extension installed. For Visual Studio and Jetbrains Rider, the test runner is built in.
